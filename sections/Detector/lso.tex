Another calorimeter concept is based on using LSO or LYSO crystals in a $3 \pi$ solid angle configuration similar to the PEN experiment discussed above. LSO has similar timing parameters to pure CsI (fast component aobut 45 ns) but much higher ligt output i.e. 75$\%$ of NaI(Tl). With a short radiation lenght about 1.1 cm, a compact calorimeter of 25-30 $X_0$ with excellent energy and time resolutions could be constructed. The same energy tail suppression would be realized as discussed above for the LXe option. The potential advantages of the crystal calorimeter approach include the absence of cryogenics and dead material, simpler mechanical facilities, and natural segmentation for handling high rates.
