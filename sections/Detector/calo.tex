\caption{Upper plot: histogram of $E_{e}^{dep}$, the $\pi_{e2}$ positron energy deposited in active components for a proposed 28 $X_{0}$ thick spherical LXe concept detector (black), compared with the same for the 12 $X_{0}$ pure CsI PEN apparatus (red), along with energy deposition
for the background $\pi \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow e$ decay chain events (blue).  Lower plot: comparison of the corresponding "tail" fractions as a function of $E_{e}^{dep}$; the LXe concept detector improves on the PEN fraction by two orders of magnitude in the region of interest.
\todo{I think we should add a PIENU spectrum as well and change the text accordingly}}

A calorimeter covering 3$\pi$ solid angle with a thickness of 28 $X_0$ could dramatically reduce the ``tail‚Äù region
%-of-interest, 
which overlaps with the Michel spectrum, a key source of systematic uncertainty, see fig.\cite{fig:tail}. 
Two scintillation calorimeter options are presently under consideration: Liquid xenon and LSO crystals. Their main properties are compared in 
Table~\ref{tab:calos}. Evaluations  of potential energy and timing performance, rate capabilities, mechanical and cryogenic facilities, and cost are ongoing.
