We present an optimistic calendar for the next five years.  We under the assumptions that all program approval stages and external funding decisions are positive and proceed without delay.  Naturally, the timeline is understood to be dependent on the actual pace of such decision milestones as well as any unforseen technical challenges.
\begin{itemize}
\item Spring/Summer 2021:  Refine simulations;  acquire small samples of testable equipment;  enlarge group
\item Fall 2021:  Develop full proposal; continue lab tests of devices; large-sample simulations
\item Winter 2022:  Submit proposal, begin to seek funding for new beamline and for large-scale prototype acquistions
\item CY 2023:  Begin beamline construction and carry out test beam campaign(s).
\item CY 2024: Begin beamline testing and evaluation;  full-scale production of detectors, electronics, DAQ subsytems
\item CY 2025: Begin data taking on \nexp
\item CY2026: Continue data taking, analysis, evaluation of equipment needed for pion beta decay phase
\end{itemize}
