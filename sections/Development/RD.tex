Our R\&D plans over the next few years will proceed along five parallel tracks: 1) Beamline design; 2) Physics and detector simulations; 3) Active Target development; 4) Calorimetry; and, 5) Electronics/Triggering/DAQ.  Groups are formed and meeting regularly.  Small prototypes are planned where appropriate to evaluate detector components.  A test-beam program will be initiated for the Active Target and Calorimeter and any specialized beam line instrumentation to be developed.   We expect considerable involvement with TRIUMF Accelerator Division experts to design the needed new beamline.
